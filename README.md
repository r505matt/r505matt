- Hi, I’m Matt
- I’m interested in machine learning and embedded systems, though I have very little experience with either.
- I’m currently learning more about data structures and algorithms, design patterns, and development principles. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects using Python, Ruby, or C for their backend.
- You can reach me at matt.montagna505@gmail.com
