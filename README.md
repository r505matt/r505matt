- 👋 Hi, I’m Matt
- 👀 I’m interested in machione learning and embedded systems, though I have very little experience with either.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about data structures and algorithms, design patterns, and development principles. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects using Python, Ruby, or C for their backend.
- 📫 You can reach me at matt.montagna505@gmail.com
